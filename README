* True Open ID adoption is still far, and the NASCAR approach doesn't help much to bring it closer.

* Initiatives like Personal Web Discovery are cool but translating an email address to an Open ID URL is just a part of the equation.

* What if we are open to any user input, taking the responsability for understanding what the user meant?

* We let him progressively learn about different choices, i.e., we could slowly push the concept that Vanity URLs are also useful for logging in.

* Then it would become common to use an URL as an "username".

In this example, the user is allowed to enter his Twitter @username, or his Facebook.com/vanityurl, or his Flickr screen name, or his Gmail address, or his blog URL.

Even if he just writes down an username, we find which one he could be referring to.
